# infra
An Ansible playbook to setup my home infrastructure. Very inspired by [notthebee's corresponding repo](https://github.com/notthebee/infra).

Currently suited for these distributions:

* Ubuntu Server 20.04
* Arch Linux 2022.01.01

The playbook is currently a work in progress and does not produce a complete system yet.
