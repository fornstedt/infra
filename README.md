# infra
An Ansible playbook to setup my home infrastructure. It assumes a fresh Ubuntu Server 20.04 install, a non-root user with sudo privileges and public SSH key access. Very inspired by [notthebee's corresponding repo](https://github.com/notthebee/infra).

The playbook is currently a work in progress and does not produce a complete system yet.
